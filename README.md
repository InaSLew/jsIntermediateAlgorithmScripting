This repo contains my solutions to the coding exercises that are part of the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on FreeCodeCamp ([FreeCodeCamp Curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/ "FreeCodeCamp Curriculum"))

### Format
Each exercise starts with the instruction and its passing criteria; then my solution.
Originally there's tests to each exercise, but they are not included atm.
